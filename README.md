# E2E Automation Framework (Playwright)

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a **production-style end-to-end UI automation framework** built using **Playwright** for the SauceDemo application. The project is designed to demonstrate **real-world QA/SDET practices**, including scalable test design, Page Object Model (POM), environment-based configuration, and comprehensive positive and negative test coverage.

This project reflects hands-on upskilling in modern automation practices and mirrors how UI automation is implemented and maintained in professional QA teams.

## 🧪 Application Under Test

**SauceDemo** – a widely used demo e-commerce application for testing automation skills.

Tested user flows include:

* Authentication (positive & negative)
* Inventory validation
* Add-to-cart and cart management
* Checkout flow (overview → completion)
* Logout functionality

## 🧠 Design Principles & Practices

* **Page Object Model (POM)** for clean separation of test logic and UI interactions
* **Environment variables (.env)** for credentials and URLs (no hardcoding)
* **Explicit, condition-based waits** instead of static timeouts
* **Positive and negative test coverage** to validate functional and error scenarios
* **Readable, maintainable test structure** aligned with real QA automation standards

---

## ⚡ CI/CD Integration
* GitHub Actions run tests on every push or pull request to main
* Generates HTML reports and Allure reports
* Supports custom reporting for advanced metrics
* Sample GitHub Actions workflow:

yaml
Copy code
name: E2E Playwright Tests
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request: { branches: [main] }

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with: { node-version: '20' }
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx playwright install
      - run: npx playwright test --reporter=html,allure-playwright
      - run: npx allure generate reports/allure-results --clean -o reports/allure-report

## ▶️ How to Run Tests

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install Playwright browsers

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Execute all tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run tests in headed mode

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file at the root level:

```
BASE_URL=https://www.saucedemo.com/
SAUCE_USERNAME=standard_user
SAUCE_PASSWORD=secret_sauce
```

Environment variables are consumed inside tests and page objects for flexibility across environments.

* Realistic E2E automation flows used in QA/SDET roles
* Strong understanding of test design, stability, and maintainability
* Hands-on Playwright experience beyond basic examples
* CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
* Advanced reporting (HTML, custom, Allure)
* A portfolio-ready automation framework suitable for professional review
